# coding-quiz-1

The application renders questions and is responsive to button clicks. It has a start button that starts the question sequence, and it has a final page where you can view your score and enter your initials.

To-do: Create a CSS to make the quiz visually appealing.
Create page separation for the starting and ending pages.
Use local storage to store the scores and initials after the user inputs the text and refreshes the page.
